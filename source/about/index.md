I am an self-taught software engineer who dropped out of middle school. I started with Python and initially got into coding through web crawling. Subsequently, I have done web crawling, neural networks, back-end development, natural language processing, DevOps, SEO, and more. My skills include Golang, Python, JavaScript, Vue, MySQL, GCP, Kubernetes, Redis, Elasticsearch, and more. Currently I am employed at Itering as a DevOps and back-end engineer and am actively learning English. I am looking forward to furthering my knowledge and expanding my skillset.
